# What it is
Quem Busca? is a personal project of mine that serves the only purpose of register the next person between me and my wife that is going to pick up the delivery.

## Why?
First of all, to finally put an end on long battle of who is the next responsable for this extremely tedious task that is walk 50 meters.
And also, that's my first attempt to learn TypeScript for real, and putting it on practice with all I believe is right, is the best opportunity to do it. That's why you're thinking right now that this whole project is a completely over engineering, and you're not wrong at all.

### Roadmap
- SMS login/signup **[in progress]**
- Create a subject (like "Who's next?") **[To do]**
- Invite someone to join your subject **[To do]**
- Pickup next between n people in a subject **[To do]**
- Implement an extra rule to allow extra pickups to be compensated by the other members **[To do]**
- Real time socket, because why not? **[in mind]**
